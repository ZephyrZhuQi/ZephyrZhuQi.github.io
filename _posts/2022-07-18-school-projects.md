# CS161 Computer Security
### Project 2: An End-to-End Encrypted File Sharing System

**Description**: In this project, you will apply the cryptographic primitives introduced in class to design and implement the client application for a secure file sharing system. Imagine something similar to Dropbox, but secured with cryptography so that the server cannot view or tamper with your data.

The client will be written in Golang and will allow users to take the following actions:

- Authenticate with a username and password;
- Save files to the server;
- Load saved files from the server;
- Overwrite saved files on the server;
- Append to saved files on the server;
- Share saved files with other users; and
- Revoke access to previously shared files.

### Final Project
In this project, we intend to reach the goal of dynamic object avoidance of drones by integrating computer vision algorithms (YOLO), object trajectory generation and estimation (probability distribution in 3D space), and path
planning of drones. Without the use of advanced and expensive industrial cameras or motion tracking systems, our implementation with only an on-board drone camera has been proved effective in four different trial trajectories.
