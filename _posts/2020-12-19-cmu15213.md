# Lecture 1: Course Overview

hello.c, Source program (text) -> Preprocessor(cpp) -> hello.i, Modified source program (text) -> Compiler(cc1) -> hello.s, Assembly program (text) -> Assembler(as) -> printf.o hello.o, Relocatable object programs (binary) -> Linker(ld) -> hello, Executable object program (binary) 

A file is a sequence of bytes, nothing more and nothing less. Every I/O device, including disks, keyboards, displays, and even networks, is modeled as a file. 

The operating system kernel serves as an intermediary between the application and the hardware. It provides three fundamental abstractions: (1) Files are abstractions for I/O devices. (2) Virtual memory is an abstraction for both main memory and disks. (3) Processes are abstractions for the processor, main memory, and I/O devices.

linux> gcc -m32 prog.c
then this program will run correctly on either a 32-bit or a 64-bit machine. On the
other hand, a program compiled with the directive

linux> gcc -m64 prog.c

will only run on a 64-bit machine. 

0x01234567

Big endian

0x100 0x101 0x102 0x103

01    23    45    67

Little endian
0x100 0x101 0x102 0x103

67    45    23    01

# Machine-Level Representation of Programs
linux> gcc -Og -S mstore.c
This will cause gcc to run the compiler, generating an assembly file mstore.s, and go no further. 

If we use the -c command-line option, gcc will both compile and assemble the code
linux> gcc -Og -c mstore.c
This will generate an object-code file mstore.o that is in binary format and hence cannot be viewed directly. 


# Lecture 13: Linking

## Linking:
Programs are translated and linked using a compiler driver:
> linux> gcc -Og -o prog main.c sum.c

> linux> ./prog

Translators
(cpp, cc1, as)

#### Space Efficiency: 

Option 1: Static Linking
* Executable files and running memory images contain only
the library code they actually use

Option 2: Dynamic linking
* Executable files contain no library code
* During execution, single copy of library code can be shared
across all executing processes

### What Do Linkers Do?

Step 1: Symbol resolution

* Programs define and reference symbols (global variables and functions):

* Symbol definitions are stored in object file (by assembler) in symbol table.
    * Symbol table is an array of entries
    * Each entry includes name, size, and location of symbol.


* <span style="color:red">During symbol resolution step, the linker associates each symbol reference
with exactly one symbol definition.</span>.

### What Do Linkers Do? (cont’d)

Step 2: Relocation

* Merges separate code and data sections into single sections
* Relocates symbols from their relative locations in the .o files to
their final absolute memory locations in the executable.
* Updates all references to these symbols to reflect their new
positions.

### Three Kinds of Object Files (Modules)
* Relocatable object file (.o file)
    * Contains code and data in a form that can be combined with other
relocatable object files to form executable object file.
        * Each .o file is produced from exactly one source (.c) file
* Executable object file (a.out file)
    * Contains code and data in a form that can be copied directly into
memory and then executed.
* Shared object file (.so file)
    * Special type of relocatable object file that can be loaded into
memory and linked dynamically, at either load time or run-time.
    * Called Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) by Windows

### Executable and Linkable Format (ELF)

* Standard binary format for object files

* One unified format for
    * Relocatable object files (.o),
    * Executable object files (a.out)
    * Shared object files (.so)

* Generic name: ELF binaries

### ELF Object File Format
* Elf header
    * Word size, byte ordering, file type (.o, exec, .so),
machine type, etc.
* Segment header table
    * Page size, virtual address memory segments
(sections), segment sizes.
* .text section
    * Code
* .rodata section
    * Read only data: jump tables, string constants, ...
* .data section
    * Initialized global variables
* .bss section
    * Uninitialized global variables
    * “Block Started by Symbol”
    * “Better Save Space”
    * Has section header but occupies no space

<img src="/images/cmu15213/elf_object_file_format.png" alt="ELF Header" width="400"/>

* .symtab section
    * Symbol table
    * Procedure and static variable names
    * Section names and locations
* .rel.text section
    * Relocation info for .text section
    * Addresses of instructions that will need to be
modified in the executable
    * Instructions for modifying
* .rel.data section
    * Relocation info for .data section
    * Addresses of pointer data that will need to be
modified in the merged executable
* .debug section
    * Info for symbolic debugging (gcc -g)
* Section header table
    * Offsets and sizes of each section

### Linker Symbols
* Global symbols
    * Symbols defined by module m that can be referenced by other modules.
    * e.g., non-static C functions and non-static global variables.
* External symbols
    * Global symbols that are referenced by module m but defined by some
other module.
* Local symbols
    * Symbols that are defined and referenced exclusively by module m.
    * e.g, C functions and global variables defined with the static attribute.
    * Local linker symbols are not local program variables

### Local Symbols
* Local non-static C variables vs. local static C variables
    * Local non-static C variables: stored on the stack
    * Local static C variables: stored in either .bss or .data

```C
static int x = 15;
int f() {
static int x = 17;
return x++;
}
int g() {
static int x = 19;
return x += 14;
}
int h() {
return x += 27;
}
```

Compiler allocates space in .data for
each definition of x

Creates local symbols in the symbol
table with unique names, e.g., x,
x.1721 and x.1724.

### How Linker Resolves Duplicate Symbol Definitions
* Program symbols are either strong or weak
    * Strong: procedures and initialized globals
    * Weak: uninitialized globals
        * Or ones declared with specifier __extern__

### Linker’s Symbol Rules
* Rule 1: Multiple strong symbols are not allowed
    * Each item can be defined only once
    * Otherwise: Linker error
* Rule 2: Given a strong symbol and multiple weak symbols,
choose the strong symbol
    * References to the weak symbol resolve to the strong symbol
* Rule 3: If there are multiple weak symbols, pick an arbitrary
one
    * Can override this with __gcc –fno-common__

__Important: Linker does not do type checking.__

### Global Variables
* Avoid if you can
* Otherwise
    * Use static if you can
    * Initialize if you define a global variable
    * Use extern if you reference an external global variable
        * Treated as weak symbol
        * But also causes linker error if not defined in some file

### Loading Executable Object Files
<img src="/images/cmu15213/memory_address_space.png" alt="ELF Header" width="400"/>

Look at addresses returned by *malloc*: actually two heaps:
have separate allocation algorithms for large objects and small objects.

### Libraries: Packaging a Set of Functions

#### Old-Fashioned Solution: Static Libraries

Static libraries (.a archive files)
* Concatenate related relocatable object files into a single file with an
index (called an archive).
* Enhance linker so that it tries to resolve unresolved external references
by looking for the symbols in one or more archives.
* If an archive member file resolves reference, link it into the executable.

<img src="/images/cmu15213/static_libraries.png" alt="ELF Header" width="1000"/>

Commonly Used Libraries

libc.a (the C standard library)
* 4.6 MB archive of 1496 object files.
* I/O, memory allocation, signal handling, string handling, data and time,
random numbers, integer math

libm.a (the C math library)
* 2 MB archive of 444 object files.
* floating point math (sin, cos, tan, log, exp, sqrt, …) 

Using Static Libraries
* Linker’s algorithm for resolving external references:
    * Scan .o files and .a files in the command line order.
    * During the scan, keep a list of the current unresolved references.
    * As each new .o or .a file, obj, is encountered, try to resolve each
unresolved reference in the list against the symbols defined in obj.
    * If any entries in the unresolved list at end of scan, then error.
* Problem:
    * Command line order matters!
    * Moral: put libraries at the end of the command line. 

```Shell
unix> gcc -static -o prog2c -L. -lvector main2.o
main2.o: In function `main':
main2.c:(.text+0x19): undefined reference to `addvec'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
```

#### Modern Solution: Shared Libraries
* Static libraries have the following disadvantages:
    * Duplication in the stored executables (every function needs libc)
    * Duplication in the running executables
    * Minor bug fixes of system libraries require each application to explicitly relink
        * Rebuild everything with glibc?
        * https://security.googleblog.com/2016/02/cve-2015-7547-glibcgetaddrinfo-stack.html
* Modern solution: shared libraries
    * Object files that contain code and data that are loaded and linked into
an application *dynamically*, at either *load-time* or *run-time*
    * Also called: dynamic link libraries, DLLs, .so files

* __Dynamic linking can occur when executable is first loaded and run (load-time linking)__
    * Common case for Linux, handled automatically by the dynamic linker
(__ld-linux.so__)
    * Standard C library (__libc.so__) usually dynamically linked
* __Dynamic linking can also occur after program has begun (run-time linking)__
    * In Linux, this is done by calls to the __dlopen()__ interface
        * Distributing software
        * High-performance web servers
        * Runtime library interpositioning
* __Shared library routines can be shared by multiple processes__
    * More on this when we learn about virtual memory

Where are the libraries found?
* Use “ldd” to find out:

```Shell
unix> ldd prog
linux-vdso.so.1 => (0x00007ffcf2998000)
libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f99ad927000)
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f99adcef000)
```

![Dynamic Linking at Load Time](/images/cmu15213/dynamic_linking_load_time.png)

#### Dynamic Linking at Run-time

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <dlfcn.h>
int x[2] = {1, 2};
int y[2] = {3, 4};
int z[2];
int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    void *handle;
    void (*addvec)(int *, int *, int *, int);
    char *error;

    /* Dynamically load the shared library that contains addvec() */
    handle = dlopen("./libvector.so", RTLD_LAZY);
    if (!handle) {
        fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", dlerror());
        exit(1);
    }
    . . .

    /* Get a pointer to the addvec() function we just loaded */
    addvec = dlsym(handle, "addvec");
    if ((error = dlerror()) != NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", error);
        exit(1);
    }

    /* Now we can call addvec() just like any other function */
    addvec(x, y, z, 2);
    printf("z = [%d %d]\n", z[0], z[1]);

    /* Unload the shared library */
    if (dlclose(handle) < 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", dlerror());
        exit(1);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Library interpositioning

powerful linking technique that
allows programmers to intercept calls to arbitrary
functions

Interpositioning can occur at:
* Compile time: When the source code is compiled
* Link time: When the relocatable object files are statically linked to
form an executable object file
* Load/run time: When an executable object file is loaded into
memory, dynamically linked, and then executed.

Some Interpositioning Applications
* Security
    * Confinement (sandboxing)
    * Behind the scenes encryption
* Debugging
    * In 2014, two Facebook engineers debugged a treacherous 1-year
old bug in their iPhone app using interpositioning
    * Code in the SPDY networking stack was writing to the wrong
location
    * Solved by intercepting calls to Posix write functions (write, writev, pwrite)

Source: Facebook engineering blog post at:
https://code.facebook.com/posts/313033472212144/debugging-file-corruption-on-ios/

* Monitoring and Profiling
    * Count number of calls to functions
    * Characterize call sites and arguments to functions
    * Malloc tracing
        * Detecting memory leaks
        * Generating address traces
* Error Checking
    * C Programming Lab used customized versions of malloc/free to do
careful error checking
    * Other labs (malloc, shell, proxy) also use interpositioning to enhance
checking capabilities

* The “-Wl” flag passes argument to linker, replacing each
comma with a space.
* The “--wrap,malloc ” arg instructs linker to resolve
references in a special way:
    * Refs to malloc should be resolved as __wrap_malloc
    * Refs to __real_malloc should be resolved as malloc

The LD_PRELOAD environment variable tells the dynamic
linker to resolve unresolved refs (e.g., to malloc)by looking in
mymalloc.so first.

# Lecture 22 Network Programming

### A Client-Server Transaction

Most network applications are based on the client-server
model:

Note: clients and servers are __processes__ running on hosts
(can be the same or different hosts)

## Global IP Internet (upper case)

* Based on the TCP/IP protocol family
    * IP (Internet Protocol)
        * Provides basic naming scheme and unreliable delivery capability of packets (datagrams) from host-to-host
    * UDP (Unreliable Datagram Protocol)
        * Uses IP to provide unreliable datagram delivery from process-to-process
    * TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
        * Uses IP to provide reliable byte streams from process-to-process over connections
* Accessed via a mix of Unix file I/O and functions from the
sockets interface

![Global IP Internet](/images/cmu15213/internet.png)

```
/* Internet address structure */
struct in_addr {
uint32_t s_addr; /* network byte order (big-endian) */
};
```
> hostname -i
> 127.0.1.1
> hostname
> omnisky
> nslookup localhost
> Server:		8.8.8.8
> Address:	8.8.8.8#53

** server can't find localhost: NXDOMAIN
Use getaddrinfo and getnameinfo functions (described
later) to convert between IP addresses and dotted decimal
format.

### Domain Naming System (DNS)
The Internet maintains a mapping between IP addresses and
domain names in a huge worldwide distributed database
called DNS

Conceptually, programmers can view the DNS database as a
collection of millions of host entries.
    * In a mathematical sense, a host entry is an equivalence class of domain
names and IP addresses.

Can explore properties of DNS mappings using nslookup

Each host has a locally defined domain name __localhost__
which always maps to the loopback address 127.0.0.1

### Internet Connections
* Clients and servers communicate by sending streams of bytes
over connections. Each connection is:
    * Point-to-point: connects a pair of processes.
    * Full-duplex: data can flow in both directions at the same time,
    * Reliable: stream of bytes sent by the source is eventually received by the destination in the same order it was sent.
* A socket is an endpoint of a connection
    * Socket address is an IPaddress:port pair
* A port is a 16-bit integer that identifies a process:
    * Ephemeral port: Assigned automatically by client kernel when client
makes a connection request.
    * Well-known port: Associated with some service provided by a server
(e.g., port 80 is associated with Web servers)


Mappings between well-known ports and service names
is contained in the file /etc/services on each Linux
machine. 

## Sockets Interface

Set of system-level functions used in conjunction with
Unix I/O to build network applications. 

Created in the early 80’s as part of the original Berkeley
distribution of Unix that contained an early version of the
Internet protocols.

Available on all modern systems(Unix variants, Windows, OS X, IOS, Android, ARM)

Remember: All Unix I/O devices, including networks, are
modeled as files
